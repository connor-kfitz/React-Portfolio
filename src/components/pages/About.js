                        <p>Hello, my name is Connor Fitzsimmons.  I am a Toronto based student, currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Devleoper course at The University of Toronto.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>In 2015 I began my post secondary education at the University of Ontario, enrolling in their mechanical engineering program.  After completing one year there, I transferred to the University of Guelph in their equivalent program.  In 2020 I graduated from Guelph with my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, specalizing in Mechatronics.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Following graduation, I began working as a Project Coordinator for Black & McDonald's Toronto Service Division, January 2021.  I gained lots of valuable experience working this position.  I've planned, priced, and executed jobs valued over $300,000.  This has greatly improved me technical, organizational, and interpersonal skills, as they needed to be refind to preform well in the position. </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>In April 2022 I decided to take my career down another path, and resigned from my position at Black & McDonald.  Since then I have been enrolled in a Full-Stack Developer Course offered by The University of Toronto. After I graduate in August 2022, I plan on seeking a job in the development field.</p>
